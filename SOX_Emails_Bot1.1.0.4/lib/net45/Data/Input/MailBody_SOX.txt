		<br>Hi {0},</br>
		<br>
		<br>Please see the attached Project Status SOX 60 Days No Activity report for your review and action.</br>
		<br>The report features pre-defined SOX questions in column Z that are based on the project status. To answer the question, select Yes/No in the drop-down menu in column AA.  This will prompt any follow up action, if needed, in the next columns ending in column AC. </br>
		<br></br>
		<br>Should a status update be required, please make the change in Oracle.</br>
		<br></br>
		<br>It's critical that all costs are received and all PO's are closed prior to changing the status to Pending FA Close. To check if there are any open PO's associated with a Project, run the <B><U>Open PO with Project Number</U></B> report from Coupa (See snip below).</br>
		<br></br>
		<br>When updating the status to Substantially Complete, the substantially complete date must be added to the Additional information tab in the project Manage Financial Project Settings in Oracle.</br>
		<br>
		<br>Kindly provide your responses, update any statuses in Oracle, and reply with the attachment directly to this email no later than EOD, {2}.</br>
